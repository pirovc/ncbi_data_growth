1. INTRODUCTION
=============================================================================
The NCBI Reference Sequence Project (RefSeq) is an effort to provide the 
best single collection of naturally occurring biomolecules, representative
of the central dogma, for each major organism. Ideally this would include 
one sequence record for each chromosome, organelle, or plasmid linked on a 
residue by residue basis to the expressed transcripts, to the translated 
proteins, and to each mature peptide product. Depending on the organism, we 
may have some, but not all, of this information at any given time. We 
pragmatically include the best view we can from available data.

Additional information about the RefSeq project is available from:
   a) RefSeq Web site  
      https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/
   b) Entrez Books, NCBI Handbook, RefSeq chapter
      https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK21091/  

1.1 This Release 
----------------
The National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) at the National
Library of Medicine (NLM), National Institutes of Health (NIH) is 
responsible for producing and distributing the RefSeq Sequence Database. 
Records are provided through a combination of collaboration and in-house 
processing including some curation by NCBI staff comprised of expert 
biologists.  

This is a full release of all NCBI RefSeq records.
The RefSeq project is an ongoing effort to provide a curated, non-redundant
collection of sequences. This release includes all of the sequence data
that we have collected at this time. Although the RefSeq collection is not yet 
complete, its value as a non-redundant dataset has reached a level that
justifies providing full releases.  

1.2 Cutoff date

1.3 RefSeq Project Background
-----------------------------

1.3.1 Sequence accessions, validation, and annotation
-----------------------------------------------------
Every sequence is assigned a stable accession and version, and 
all older versions remain available over time. RefSeq accessions
have a distinct format (see section 3.6); the underscore ("_") is the 
primary distinguishing feature of a RefSeq accession. 
DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank accessions never include an underscore.

Sequences are validated in several ways. For example, to confirm 
that genomic sequence from the region of the mRNA feature really 
does match the mRNA sequence itself, and that the annotated coding region 
features really can be translated into the protein sequences they refer to.
Validation also checks for valid ASN.1 format. Validation also ensures that
consistency is maintained in descriptive information (symbols, gene and 
protein names) between RefSeq and Gene records.

Each molecule is annotated as accurately as possible with the 
correct organism name, the correct gene symbol for that organism, 
and reasonable names for proteins where possible. When available, 
nomenclature provided by official nomenclature groups is used.  
Note that gene symbols are not required or expected to be unique 
either across species or within a species. 

1.3.2 Data assembly, curation, and collaboration 
------------------------------------------------
We welcome collaborations with authoritative groups outside NCBI 
who are willing to provide the sequences, annotations, or links 
to phenotypic or organism specific resources. Where such collaborations 
have not yet developed, NCBI staff have assembled the best view of 
the organism that we can put together ourselves. In some cases, as with the 
human genome, NCBI is an active participant in generating the 
genome assembly and in providing reference sequences to represent 
the annotated genome. For other genomes, we may compile the data 
ourselves from DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank or other public sources. For instance,  
we may simply select the "best" DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank record by automatic means, 
validate the data format (and correct if needed), and add an essentially 
unchanged copy to the RefSeq collection, attributed to the original 
DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank record. In other cases we may provide a record that is very 
similar to the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank record, but to which experts at NCBI have added 
corrected or additional annotation. This latter process can range 
from minor technical repairs to a manually curated re-annotation of 
the sequence, often in collaboration with experts outside NCBI. 

Each record that has been curated, or that is in the pool for
future curation, is labeled with the level of curation it has received.  
Curation status information is provided primarily for transcript and 
protein records.  Curation is carried out on the whole genome level 
for some smaller genomes such as viral, organelle, and some microbial
genomes.  

Curation status codes are defined in the section 3.2 below.

1.3.3 Biologically non-redundant data set
-----------------------------------------
RefSeq provides a biologically non-redundant set of sequences for database 
searching and gene characterization. It has the advantage of providing an 
objective and experimentally verifiable definition of "non-redundant" in 
supplying one example of each natural biomolecule per organism or sample.
The small amount of sequence redundancy introduced from close paralogs,
alternate splicing products, and genome assembly intermediates is compensated
for by the clarity of the model. RefSeq provides the substrate for a variety
of conclusions about non-redundancy based on clustering identical sequences, 
or families of related sequences, without confounding the database itself 
with these more subjective assessments.

1.3.4 RefSeq and DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank comparison
---------------------------------------------
RefSeq is unique in providing a large curated database across many 
organisms, which precisely and explicitly links genetic (chromosome), 
expression (mRNA), and functional (protein) sequence data into an 
integrated whole. 

DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank also integrates DNA and protein information, and RefSeq is 
substantially based on sequence records contributed to DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank. 
However, RefSeq is similar to a review article in that it represents 
a synthesis and summary of information by a particular group (NCBI or 
other RefSeq contributors) that is based on the primary data gathered 
by many others and made part of the scientific record. Also, like a 
review article, it has the advantage of organizing a large body of 
diverse data into a single consistent framework with a uniform set of 
conventions and standards.

Note that while based on DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank, RefSeq is distinct from 
DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank. DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank represents the sequence and annotations 
supplied by the original authors and is never changed by NCBI or RefSeq staff. 
DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank remains the primary sequence archive while RefSeq is a 
summary and synthesis based on that essential primary data.

1.4 Uses and applications of the RefSeq database
------------------------------------------------
A stable, consistent, comprehensive, non-redundant database of genomes
and their products provides a valuable sequence resource for similarity 
searching, gene identification, protein classification, comparative 
genomics, and selection of probes for gene expression. It also acts as 
molecular "white pages" by providing a single, uniform point of access 
for searching at the sequence level, and by connecting the results with 
a diversity of organism-specific databases or resources unique to that 
organism or field. 

=============================================================================
2. CONTENT
=============================================================================
2.1 Organisms included
----------------------
This number of organisms reported for the release (section 3.5 below) is 
determined by counting the number of distinct tax_ids included in the release.
Tax_ids are provided by the NCBI Taxonomy group. Tax_ids were historically 
provided for all species and strains having any amount of sequence data. In 2014
NCBI stopped assigning strain-level tax_ids. Strains are now being tracked by
the BioSample database.  

The release includes species ranging from viral to microbial to eukaryotic and 
includes organisms for which complete and incomplete genomic sequence data is 
available.  

The release does not include all species for which some sequence data is
available in DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank. The decision to generate RefSeq data for a 
species or strain depends in part on the amount of sequence data available.  
Additional species will be represented in the RefSeq collection as more
sequence data becomes available.

2.2 Molecule Types Included
---------------------------
The RefSeq release includes genomic, transcript, and protein sequence data; 
however, these molecule types are not provided for all organisms and the 
sequences provided may not be complete or comprehensive for some species.  

Transcript RefSeq records may represent protein-coding transcripts or 
non-coding RNA products; these records are currently only provided for 
eukaryotic species.

Genomic RefSeq records are provided when a sufficient quantity of genomic 
sequence data is available in DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank. Transcript and protein 
records may be provided for a species before genomic sequence data is available.

2.3 Known Problems, Redundancies, and Inconsistencies
------------------------------------------------------

Known Problems with RefSeq release 200:	
======================================

There are no known problems with RefSeq release 200. 

Known Redunancies and Inconsistencies:
======================================
The RefSeq collection is an ongoing project that is expected to grow
in scope and content over time.  Thus it is important to recognize that
it is not complete in that some genomes are not yet completely sequenced,
some incompletely sequenced genomes may not be included, or some gene 
products may not yet be represented. RefSeq records may be added, removed, 
or updated in future releases as new information becomes available and as 
a result of curation.

Known Data inconsistencies:

	[1] RefSeq status codes are not consistently provided for some species. 
	The goal is to consistently provide a status code for all RefSeq
	records. The release catalog indicates "UNKNOWN" if a status code
	was expected but not detected and "na" if a status code is not
	expected based on the original project plan for provision of this type
	of information. Status codes will be more consistently applied to all 
	records in the future.

	[2] The genomic, transcript, and protein collection is known to be 
	incomplete for many species. This is particularly true for those
	genomes for which a complete genome assembly is not yet available, 
	such as Sus scrofa (pig). As additional sequence data becomes available, 
	the RefSeq representation for this, and other, organisms will increase. 
	
	[3] Whole genome shotgun (WGS) assemblies of organelle, plastid, or viral genomes 
	are included in the complete node and in the taxonomic group that the 
	whole genome WGS project is reported in (e.g., fungi etc.). Our process 
	flow for WGS data provides a data extraction per WGS project with no 
	distinction by molecule (such as mitochondrial). Therefore, some 
	nodes do not include WGS data or may include WGS data for different taxa.
        For instance, NZ_ACSJ01000000 includes contigs representing two tax_ids - 
	a bacterium and a phage.  The entire WGS project has been processed for the 
	complete node and the microbial node in this release.  Therefore, the microbial 
	node includes a small amount of viral sequence and the viral node omits this data. 
    	NZ_ACSJ01000001 to NZ_ACSJ01000011 microbial contigs
    	NZ_ACSJ01000012 to NZ_ACSJ01000019 viral contigs

	[4] Although the goal is to provide a non-redundant collection, some
	redundancy is included in this release as follows. 	

	Redundant Protein records:
	    Alternate Splicing		When additional transcripts are provided
					to represent alternate splicing products, 
					and the alternate splice site occurs in 
					the UTR, then the protein is redundantly 
					provided.

	    Paralogs (eukaryotes)	The goal is to provide a RefSeq record 
					for each naturally occurring molecule. 
					Therefore, records are provided for all 
					genes identified including those produced 
					by more recent gene duplication events in 
					which the genes are nearly identical.
	
	Redundant Genomic records:				
	   Intermediate records		For some species, intermediate genomic 
					records are provided to support the 
					assembly and/or annotation of the genome.
	
					For example, for human, a chromosome may 
					be represented by a chromosome RefSeq 
					record with a NC_ accession prefix.
					The chromosome record may consist of 
					many contigs, each represented as a 
					separate record with a NT_ accession
					prefix. In addition, some curated gene
					region records, with NG_ accession
					prefix, may also be provided to support
					annotation of complex regions.
					
	   Alternate assemblies		Genomic records are provided to represent 
					alternate assemblies of genomic sequence
					derived from different populations. These 
					records will have varying levels of 
					redundancy and represent polymorphic and
					haplotype differences in terms of the
					sequence and annotation.

					For example, alternate assemblies are
					provided for different mouse strains and
					for regions of the human major
					histocompatibility complex (MHC). The MHC
					is a highly variable region of chromosome
					6 which exhibits variation at the level 
					of both sequence polymorphism and gene 
					content. The alternate assemblies make it
					possible to represent this alternate gene
					content. 					

	Prokaryotic strains		Prokaryotic genome sequence data derived from 
		  			different strains may be represented as 
					additional RefSeq records. This introduces 
					redundancy but may also add representation for 
					some proteins that are unique to a strain.  
					RefSeq records for a specific strain can be 
					identified by the unique taxonomic ID for that 
					strain. The protein complement is non-redundant.

	[5] Note that for some organisms, most notably vertebrates, processing to update 
	    individual transcript and protein records may occur on a daily basis. Transcript 
	    and protein updates may include changes to descriptive information such as 
	    publications, names, or feature annotations. Updates can also include changes 
	    to the sequence or the addition of new sequence records. Thus information 
	    available on transcript and protein records may be more current than the 
	    annotated genome.  

2.4 Release Catalog
-------------------
The Release Catalog documents the full contents of the RefSeq Release.
The catalog can be used to identify data of interest.  See the format
description in section 3.6 for additional information.

The release catalog is available at:
  ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/release/release-catalog/RefSeq-release#.catalog

The catalog for previous releases is available in the archive directory:
  ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/release/release-catalog/archive/

2.5 Changes since the previous release	  
--------------------------------------
[1] The number of organisms in RefSeq crosses 100,000!
    The current RefSeq release contains 100,605 distinct species or taxons, with a net increase of 763 species since Release 99.
    This milestone coincides with the 100th release though the current release number is 200 (see below). Note that there is a
    decrease in the number of species for prokaryotes (bacteria and archaea) due to a clean up that mainly removed unclassified
    bacteria, and assemblies from Metagenome-Assembled Genomes (MAGs).

[2] The FTP release number has skipped to 200
    As previously announced, NCBI’s Reference Sequence (RefSeq) FTP release number has incremented to 200 for this release, and
    skipped over the numbers 100-199. The previous, March 2020 release, was release 99. This change is to avoid overlapping with
    the release numbers of the independently numbered RefSeq annotation releases for the eukaryotic genomes we annotate, which
    are currently in the range 100-109, for example Mus musculus Annotation Release 108.

[3] NCBI Protein Families
    A new release of the NCBI protein families profiles used by PGAP (the Prokaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline) is now available.
    You can search this collection of Hidden Markov models (HMM) against your favorite prokaryotic proteins to identify their
    function using hmmer.

    NCBI Insights: https://go.usa.gov/xvsEB

[4] Recalculation of Prokaryotic Reference and Representative Genome Assemblies
    We have updated the collection of reference and representative assemblies for Bacteria and Archaea to better reflect the
    taxonomic breadth of the prokaryotes in RefSeq. We have selected one reference or representative assembly for every species
    based on several criteria including contiguity, completeness, and whether the assembly is from type material.

Previous Announcement:
----------------------	
[1] Updated human genome Annotation Release 109.20200228
    Annotation Release 109.20200228 is a quarterly update of the human annotation incorporating the latest set of curated RefSeq
    transcript changes.

    The annotation report for 109.20200228 is available here:
      https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/annotation_euk/Homo_sapiens/109.20200228/

    The annotation products are available in the sequence databases and on the FTP site.
      ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/all/annotation_releases/9606/109.20200228/

[2] Important changes to the genomes FTP site
    We have added the latest NCBI Eukaryotic Genome Annotation Pipeline results for the more than 580 species that we annotate
    to the genomes/refseq directory on the genomes FTP area.
      https://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/refseq/

    As we announced in December, we will stop publishing annotation results to the genus_species directories (example:
    genomes/Xenopus_tropicalis) on the genomes FTP site effective February 1, 2020. We will also move existing genus_species
    directories to genomes/archive/old_refseq during the month of March 2020.

    Useful link: https://ncbiinsights.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2020/02/07/genomes-ftp/

[3] Drosophila assemblies and annotation
    In coordination with FlyBase, NCBI is transitioning almost all of the Drosophila assemblies included in the RefSeq collection
    to annotation produced and distributed primarily through NCBI, using NCBI's eukaryotic genomic annotation pipeline. The one
    exception is for Drosophila melanogaster, which will continue to use the reference annotation produced and submitted by FlyBase.
    This will allow us to provide consistent, high-quality annotation across the full spectrum of Drosophila species and rapidly
    provide annotation as new high-quality assemblies become available. Data is available in NCBI nucleotide, protein, BLAST, Gene,
    Genome Data Viewer, Genomes, Assembly, and via FTP in both the RefSeq FTP release and on the NCBI genomes FTP site at
    ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/refseq/invertebrate/. More information about our annotation process is available at
    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/annotation_euk/process/.

    23 Drosophila species are now included in the RefSeq dataset. Of the original twelve published by the Drosophila 12 Genomes
    Consortium in 2007 (PMID:17994087), updates for five are included in RefSeq Release 99, and updates for six others are either
    underway or planned. Most use new high-contiguity assemblies that have been publicly released in the last few years. In
    accordance with the Fort Lauderdale Agreement (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fort_Lauderdale_Agreement), please check the
    publication status of the genomes/assemblies before publishing any genome-wide analyses using these data. The annotation produced
    for RefSeq is within the public domain; we request that NLM/NCBI be cited (PMID:26553804) if using these data.

Announcing Future Changes:  			      
--------------------------
[1] Mouse Reference Assembly Update
    A full assembly update for the mouse GRCm38.p6 reference assembly is expected to be released in 2020 by the GRC. We anticipate
    updating the mouse RefSeq annotation to the new GRCm39 assembly this summer, for either RefSeq FTP Release 201 or 202.
    
[2] We will continue to update the human genome annotation on a more frequent basis to more quickly incorporate ongoing
    curation work as part of the MANE project and other curation activities. Further details are available at:
      https://ncbiinsights.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/2019/03/26/human-genome-annotation-bimonthly-update/
    The last update was in late February 2020.

Sequence Data Directories and Files:
------------------------------------
The RefSeq collection is provided in a redundant fashion to best meet the needs
of those who want the full collection as well as those who want a specific
sub-set of the collection.  Therefore the collection is provided as: 
   1) the complete collection, and
   2) sections as defined by major taxonomic or other logical groupings. 

A subdirectory exists for each sub-section as follows:
   archaea
   bacteria
   fungi						
   invertebrate	
   mitochondrion
   other	
   plant
   plasmid		
   plastid		
   protozoa	
   vertebrate_mammalian	
   vertebrate_other	
   viral			

In addition, the complete collection is available without these
sub-groupings in the subdirectory:
   complete

Note that this directory structure intentionally provides the release 
data in a redundant fashion. We gave considerable thought to how to
package the release to meet the needs of different user groups. 
For instance, some groups may be interested in retrieving the complete
protein set, while other groups may be interested in retrieving data 
for a more limited number of organisms.  We decided to provide
logical groupings based on general taxonomic node (viral, mammalian etc.)
as well as logical molecule type compartmentalization (e.g., plastid).
Thus, all records are provided at least twice, once in the "complete" 
directory, and a second time in one of the other directories. 
Some sequences may be provided three times when it is logical to 
include the record in more than one additional directory. For example, 
a sequence may be provided in the "complete", "mitochondrion", and 
"vertebrate_mammalian" directories.

We are interested in hearing if you find this structure useful or if
you would like information grouped in a different manner.

3.2 Release Contents
--------------------
A comprehensive list of sequence files provided for the current release
is available in:
   ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/release/release-catalog/release#.files.installed

A comprehensive list of sequence records included in the current release is 
available in:
   ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/release/release-catalog/release#.catalog

File name format indicates the directory node, molecule type, and format type. 

Name format:

 complete.10.1.bna.gz
|--------|--|-|---|--|
   1      2  3  4   5

   1. directory location 
   2. numerical increment 
       -to provide a set of unique file names
   3. optional: sub-part number 
       -to provide a unique file name for genomic FASTA files which may be split 
        based on size
   4. format type 
   5. compression

Multiple files may be provided for any given molecule and format type, indicated 
by a numerical increment in the file names. Files of the same molecule type and 
increment are related by content. Files of different molecule type and the same 
increment may or may not have related content. For example:

    complete.1006.bna.gz
    complete.1006.1.genomic.fna.gz
    complete.1006.2.genomic.fna.gz  -- genomic FASTA split into two sub-parts 
                                       due to size 
    complete.1006.genomic.gbff.gz  --  content related to the two 
                                       1006.#.genomic.fna.gz files 
    complete.1006.protein.faa.gz 
    complete.1006.protein.gpff.gz  -- contains proteins found in either genomic 
                                      or rna files of this increment 
    complete.1006.rna.fna.gz
    complete.1006.rna.gbff.gz  -- unrelated to the contents of the genomic files 
                                  of this increment

If you are interested in a complete set of genomic, protein, and rna files for a given 
tax_id, you must scan all files from the directory. You may also want to consider using 
the per-assembly files provided at ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/refseq/ instead. 
More information is available at:
    https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genome/doc/ftpfaq/

Note that for some molecule and format types, a number increment is skipped.
This is not an error. It is also not an error if a filename provided with one
release is not provided with a different release.  
For example:
   complete.281.genomic.gbff.gz
   complete.282.genomic.gbff.gz
   complete.284.genomic.gbff.gz
   complete.285.genomic.gbff.gz  
   complete.287.genomic.gbff.gz --release 70 did not include files named as
                               complete.283.genomic or complete.286.genomic
                               because complete.283.bna & complete.286.bna 
                               did not include genomic data.

The RefSeq release processing first produces a comprehensive set of ASN.1 files, 
ordered by tax_id, and limited by a size constraint.  These initial files
are further processed to export the records by molecule and format type.
If the initial ASN.1 file does not include any records for a given molecule type, 
such as genomic sequence data, then the corresponding 'genomic' fasta and 
flatfile records will not be found.

The installed release includes a comprehensive report of all files installed
for a given release. Please refer to /release-catalog/release#.files.installed
(where # is the release number).

3.3 File Names and Formats 
--------------------------
File names are informative, and indicate the content, molecule type,
and file format of each RefSeq release data file. Most filenames
utilize this structure:

	directory.filenumber.subpart.molecule.format.gz
	1         2	     3       4        5	  

File Name Key:

	1. directory		directory level the file is provided in 
				(e.g.,complete, viral etc)
	2. file	number:		large data sets are provided as incrementally 
				numbered files 
        3. sub-part number:     large genomic fasta files may be split to facilitate transfer
	4. molecule		type of molecule (genomic, rna, or protein); 
				not relevant for ASN.1 format files provided 
				in the "complete" sub-directory
	5. format		the data format provided in the file; see below

For example:
	complete1.genomic.bna.gz
        vertebrate_mammalian2.protein.gpff.gz

RefSeq Whole Genome Shotgun (WGS) data are provided in files provided 
per WGS project.  Their filenames use a slightly different structure:
	directoryWGSproject.molecule.format.gz

For example:
	completeNZ_AAAU.bna.gz
        microbialNZ_AAAV.genomic.fna.gz

The filenames for RefSeq non-redundant proteins also use a slightly different 
structure:
	directory.nonredundant_protein.filenumber.molecule.format.gz

For example:
	complete.nonredundant_protein.20.protein.faa.gz
	bacteria.nonredundant_protein.105.protein.gpff.gz

The term "non-redundant protein" refers to the representation of identical 
proteins in the prokaryotic RefSeq protein dataset using a single non-redundant 
protein accession number (with the prefix 'WP_'). Non-redundant RefSeq protein 
records, which are currently provided for archaeal and bacterial RefSeq genomes, 
may be found in RefSeq genomes from multiple species. More information about this 
type of RefSeq protein record can be be found here:
     	https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/about/nonredundantproteins/ 
        ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/release/announcements/WP-proteins-06.10.2013.pdf
	

All RefSeq release files have been compressed with the gzip utility;
therefore, an invariant ".gz" suffix is present for all release files.

The data that comprises a RefSeq release are available in several
file formats, as indicated by the format component in the file name:
  bna	binary ASN.1 format; includes nucleotide and protein 
  gbff	GenBank flat file format; nucleotide records
  gpff	GenPept flat file format; protein records
  fna	FASTA format; nucleotide records
  faa	FASTA format; protein records

The comprehensive full release is deposited in the "complete"
directory and is available in all file types.

Binary ASN.1 format is only provided in the complete directory. The remaining
directories include all of the remaining file types.

The DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank and GenPept flat file format provided in this release 
matches that seen when accessing the records using the NCBI web site. 
Notably, some RefSeq record are in the CON division and do not instantiate 
the sequence on the flat file display, instead a 'join' statement is provided 
to indicate the assembly instructions.  The FASTA files do include the 
assembled sequences for these CON division RefSeq records.  

For example, see NC_000022.11

Suggestions regarding the structure of the RefSeq release product 
and the available formats may be sent to the NCBI Help Desk:
    info@ncbi.nlm.nih.gov

3.4 File Sizes	
--------------
RefSeq release files are provided in a range of sizes. Most are
limited to several hundred megabytes (MB) and uncompressed ASN.1 file
size will not exceed 500 MB. Nucleotide FASTA files are split when 
they reach 1 gigabyte (GB).

Files are compressed to reduce file size and facilitate FTP retrieval.

The total size of release 200 is as follows:

         Extension    Size (GB)          Type
         -----------------------------------------------------------
         bna          1783.82             ASN.1
         gbff         2753.32             GenBank flat file
         gpff         836.45              GenPept flat file
         fna          3795.37             FASTA, nucleotide
         faa          160.50              FASTA, protein

Notes: 
 [A] The complete directory provides all file types. The ASN.1 format is only 
     available in the complete directory; the file sizes reported for the 
     remaining file formats represents the redundant total found in the complete 
     plus other directories.

3.5 Statistics

3.6 Release Catalog Format
--------------------------
The full non-redundant contents of the release are documented in the 
release catalog. 

Available at:
   ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/release/release-catalog/

The catalog includes the following columns:
  1. tax_id
  2. Taxon name
  3. RefSeq accession.version
  4. FTP directories data is provided in, '|' separated
  5. RefSeq status code
  6. sequence length

Note: the molecule type for each catalog entry can be inferred from 
the accession prefix (see below).

RefSeq Status Codes are documented on the RefSeq web site. The catalog includes 
the following terms:

  na			Not Applicable; 
			status codes are not provided for some records

  UNKNOWN		The status code has not yet been applied or status is not
  			applicable to the type of record. 

  REVIEWED		The RefSeq record has been the reviewed by NCBI  
			staff or by a collaborator. Some RefSeq records 
			may incorporate expanded sequence and annotation 
			information including additional publications 
			and features. This indicates a curated record.

  VALIDATED		The RefSeq record has undergone an initial review 
			to provide the preferred sequence standard. The  
			record has not yet been subject to final review 
			at which time additional functional information 
			may be provided. This indicates a curated record.	
			
  PROVISIONAL		The RefSeq record has not yet been subject to 
			individual review and is thought to be well 
			supported and to represent a valid transcript 
			and protein. This record is not curated.
			
  PREDICTED		The RefSeq transcript may represent an ab initio 
			prediction or may be weakly supported by transcripts
			or protein homology. This record is not curated.
			
  INFERRED		The RefSeq record is inferred by genome sequence 
			analysis. This record is not curated.

  MODEL			RefSeq records provided via automated processing 
  			and are not subject to individual review or revision 
			between builds. This record is not curated.

3.7 Removed Records
-------------------
This is a report of accessions that were included in the
previous release but are no longer included in the current release.

Available at:
   ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/release/release-catalog/
   release#.removed-records file format

The file includes the following columns:

  1. tax_id
  2. species name
  3. RefSeq accession.version
  4. FTP directories data was provided in, in last release
  5. RefSeq status code
  6. sequence length

           temporarily suppressed [record may become available again in the future]

3.8 RefSeq Accession Format
---------------------------
RefSeq accessions are formatted as a two letter prefix, followed by 
an underscore, followed by six or nine digits, or 4 letters plus eight digits. 
For example, NM_020236, NP_001107345, and NZ_AABC02000001.  

The underscore ("_") is the primary distinguishing feature of a RefSeq 
accession; DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank accessions never include an underscore.

4.1.1 LOCUS, DEFLINE, ACCESSION, KEYWORDS, SOURCE, ORGANISM 
--------------------------------------------------------------------
The beginning of each RefSeq record provides information about the accession,
length, molecule type, division, and last update date. This is followed by the 
descriptive DEFINITION line, then by the Accession and version, followed by
detailed information about the organism and taxomonic lineage.

Note: The VERSION number increments when a sequence is updated, 
while the ACCESSION remains the same.  The "ACCESSION.VERSION" 
identifier provides the finest resolution reference to a sequence.

4.1.2 REFERENCE, DIRECT SUBMISSION, COMMENT, PRIMARY
-------------------------------------------
REFERENCE: 
While the majority of RefSeq records do include REFERENCE
data, this data is not required and some records do not include any
citations. Publications are propagated from the GenBank record(s) from which
the RefSeq is derived, provided by collaborating groups and NCBI staff
during the curation process, and provided by the National Library of
Medicine (NLM) PubMed MeSH indexing staff as they add new articles to PubMed.

Functionally relevant citations are added by individual scientists using
the Entrez Gene GeneRIF submission form, and a significant volume of citation
connections are supplied by the NLM MeSH indexing staff for human, 
mouse, rat, zebrafish,and cow. This functionality is expected to increase 
in the future to treat all organisms represented in the RefSeq collection.  
Citations supplied by the MeSH indexers and individual scientists can be 
identified by the presence of a REMARK beginning with the text string "GeneRIF".
This represents a significant method to keep sequence connections to the
literature up-to-date; GeneRIFs add considerable value to the RefSeq 
collection.

For more information on GeneRIFs please see:

   https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gene/about-generif 

For example, several GeneRIFs have been added to NM_000173.7, including:

DIRECT SUBMISSION: 
A Direct Submission field is provided on some RefSeq records but not all. It
is propagated from the underlying GenBank record from which the RefSeq is 
derived or provided on submissions from collaborating groups. Transcript
and protein RefSeqs for human, mouse, rat, zebrafish, and cow do not provide
this field as records often include additional data and are not necessarily
direct copies of the GenBank submission.

COMMENT: 
A COMMENT is provided for the majority of RefSeq records. We are working to supply 
a COMMENT more comprehensively in the future. A COMMENT is always provided if 
the version number has  changed. 

COMMENT sections may include information on:	 
    RefSeq Status (PROVISIONAL, INFERRED, VALIDATED REVIEWED, etc.)
    Information on collaborating groups (e.g. RefSeqGene project)
    GenBank records(s) from which the RefSeq is derived. 
    Version changes
    A summary about sequence function
    Description of transcript variants
    Sequence note to describe the components of the RefSeq transcript
    Evidence data describing transcript and RNA-Seq support for the RefSeq transcript
    Attributes: examples - 'non-AUG initiation codon', 'Protein has antimicrobial activity',
                           'RefSeq Select criteria'
    5' and/or 3' completeness of the RefSeq transcript			   
	
Example: COMMENT section of NM_004323.6 
//
COMMENT     REVIEWED REFSEQ: This record has been curated by NCBI staff. The
            reference sequence was derived from AL356472.17 and AL161445.10.
            On Nov 23, 2018 this sequence version replaced NM_004323.5.
            
            Summary: The oncogene BCL2 is a membrane protein that blocks a step
            in a pathway leading to apoptosis or programmed cell death. The
            protein encoded by this gene binds to BCL2 and is referred to as
            BCL2-associated athanogene. It enhances the anti-apoptotic effects
            of BCL2 and represents a link between growth factor receptors and
            anti-apoptotic mechanisms. Multiple protein isoforms are encoded by
            this mRNA through the use of a non-AUG (CUG) initiation codon, and
            three alternative downstream AUG initiation codons. A related
            pseudogene has been defined on chromosome X. [provided by RefSeq,
            Feb 2010].
            
            Transcript Variant: This transcript (1) encodes multiple isoforms
            due to the use of alternative translation initiation codons. The
            longest isoform (BAG-1L or p50) is derived from an upstream non-AUG
            (CUG) start codon, while three shorter isoforms are derived from
            downstream AUG start codons. The longest isoform (BAG-1L) is
            represented in this RefSeq.
            
            Sequence Note: This RefSeq record was created from transcript and
            genomic sequence data to make the sequence consistent with the
            reference genome assembly. The genomic coordinates used for the
            transcript record were based on transcript alignments.
            
            CCDS Note: This CCDS ID represents the longest human BAG1 isoform,
            known as BAG-1L or p50, as described in the literature, including
            PMIDs 9396724, 9679980, 9747877 and 17662274. This isoform
            initiates translation at a non-AUG (CUG) start codon that is
            well-conserved and present in a strong Kozak signal context.
            Alternative translation initiation at downstream AUG start codons
            produces three additional isoforms with shorter N-termini, known as
            BAG-1M or p46, BAG-1S or p36 (also known as p33), and p29. The most
            abundant of the shorter isoforms, BAG-1S, is represented by CCDS
            55301.1. Evidence in PMIDs 9747877 and 17662274 indicates that
            these isoforms have distinct subcellular distributions, which may
            contribute to the multifunctionality of the protein.

4.1.3 NUCLEOTIDE FEATURE ANNOTATION
-----------------------------------
Gene, mRNA, CDS:
Every effort is made to consistently provide the Gene and coding sequence (CDS)
feature (when relevant). If a RefSeq is based on a GenBank record that is only 
annotated with the CDS, then a Gene feature is created.  mRNA features are 
provided for most eukaryotic records; this is not yet comprehensively provided
and will improve in future releases.

Gene Names: 
Gene symbols and names are provided by external official 
nomenclature groups for some organisms.  If official nomenclature is 
not available we may use a systemic name provided by the data submittor 
or apply a more functional name during curation. When official nomenclature 
is available we may provide additional alternate names for some organisms.

Variation:
Variation is computed by the dbSNP database staff and added via post-processing
to RefSeq records.

Miscellaneous:
For some records, additional annotation may be provided when identified by the 
curation staff or provided by a collaborating group. For example, the location 
of polyA signal and sites may be included.

4.1.4 PROTEIN FEATURE ANNOTATION
--------------------------------
Protein Names: 
Protein names may be provided by a collaborating group, may be based on the 
Gene Name, or for some records, the curation process may identify the 
preferred protein name based on that associated with a specific EC number 
or based on the literature.

Protein Products:
Signal peptide and mature peptide annotation is provided by propagation from 
the GenBank submission that the RefSeq is based on, when provided by a 
collaborating group, or when determined by the curation process.

Domains:
Domains are computed by alignment to the NCBI Conserved Domain Database 
database for  human, mouse, rat, zebrafish, nematode, and cow.  The best 
hits are annotated on the RefSeq. For some records, additional functionally 
significant regions of the protein may be annotated by the curation staff.
Domain annotation is not provided comprehensively at this time.

4.2 Tracking Identifiers
------------------------
Several identifiers are provided on RefSeq records that can be used to track 
relationships between annotated features, relationships between RefSeq records, 
and changes to RefSeq records over time. 

The GeneID identifies the related Gene, mRNA, and CDS features. 
Transcript IDs (RefSeq accessions) provide an explicit connection between a 
transcript feature annotated on a genomic RefSeq record, and the RefSeq 
transcript record itself. Likewise, the Protein ID (RefSeq accessions) provides 
the association between the annotated CDS feature on a genomic or transcript 
RefSeq record, and the protein record itself.

Changes to a RefSeq sequence over time can be identified by changes to the version
number.
	
4.2.1 GeneID
------------
A gene feature database cross-reference qualifier (dbxref), the GeneID, 
is provided on many RefSeq records to support access to the Entrez Gene
database. 

Entrez Gene provides gene-oriented information for a sub-set of the
RefSeq collection. Gene includes data for all Eukaryotic genomes, viral genomes,
and a representative Prokaryotic genomes. 

The GeneID  provides a distinct tracking identifier for a gene
or locus and is provided on the gene, mRNA, and CDS features. The GeneID 
can be used to identify a set of related features; this is especially useful 
when multiple products are provided to represent alternate splicing events.
	
For example:

NC_000003.12	Homo sapiens chromosome 3, GRCh38.p13 Primary Assembly.

//

     gene            38038595..38124025
                     /gene="DLEC1"
                     /gene_synonym="CFAP81; DLC-1; DLC1; F56"
                     /note="DLEC1 cilia and flagella associated protein;
                     Derived by automated computational analysis using gene
                     prediction method: BestRefSeq,Gnomon."
                     /db_xref="GeneID:9940"	<<<--- GeneID
                     /db_xref="HGNC:HGNC:2899"
                     /db_xref="MIM:604050"

//
	

When viewing RefSeq records via the internet, the GeneID is hot-linked to Entrez
Gene. 

4.2.2 Transcript ID
-------------------
The transcript_id qualifier found on a mRNA or other RNA feature annotation
provides an explicit correspondence between a feature annotation on a genomic 
record and the RefSeq transcript record.

For example:

NC_000022.11	Homo sapiens chromosome 22, GRCh38.p13 Primary Assembly.   

//

     mRNA            complement(46255663..46263343)
                     /gene="PKDREJ"
                     /product="polycystin family receptor for egg jelly"
                     /note="Derived by automated computational analysis using
                     gene prediction method: BestRefSeq."
                     /transcript_id="NM_006071.2"	<<<--- linked RefSeq transcript
                     /db_xref="GeneID:10343"
                     /db_xref="HGNC:HGNC:9015"
                     /db_xref="MIM:604670"

//

		
4.2.3 Protein ID
----------------
The protein_id qualifier found on a coding region (CDS) feature provides an 
explicit correspondance between feature annotation on a genomic or transcript 
RefSeq record and the RefSeq transcript record.

For example:

NC_001144.5 	Saccharomyces cerevisiae S288C chromosome XII, complete sequence. 

//

     CDS             complement(16639..17613)

 //

4.2.4 Conserved Domain Database (CDD) ID
----------------------------------------
Protein domain annotation is calculated by the Conserved Domain Database
and is included in RefSeq protein records processed for the FTP site. Domain
annotation appears as a Region feature on protein records and is propagated to
associated transcript features (if available) as a misc_feat. The feature
annotation includes a dbxref cross-reference to the CDD database that may change
over time.  The dbxref retrieves a domain model as calculated at a point in time;
recalculation of domains by the CDD group may result in a new CDD identifier value.
The CDD dbxref values that are available in the RefSeq release, although not 
stable, will continue to retrieve data from the CDD database where a newer 
identifier value may be found.

For example:

NP_000550.2	 hemoglobin subunit gamma-1 [Homo sapiens].        

//

     Region          7..146
                     /region_name="Hb-beta_like"

                     Hb subunits; cd08925"
